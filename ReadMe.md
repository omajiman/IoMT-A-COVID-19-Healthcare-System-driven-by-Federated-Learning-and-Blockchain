Today, we are going to provide you with the python implementation our proposed scheme titled 
"Towards an Efficient IoMT: Privacy Infrastructure for COVID-19 Pandemic based on Federated Learning
 and Blockchain Technology"

The proposed blockchain based federated learning (FL) model uses COVID-19 epidemiological data 
from different centres for disease control (CDCs) to predict the progression of COVID-19 
infectious and susceptible individuals.
Our target variable is a continuous Quantitative measure of the COVID-19 infectious and susceptible 
individuals' progression, which is solved by linear regression. 
Moreover, a logistic regression model is adopted.
We consider horizontally federated learning model in which COVID-19 data having the same features 
is divided into more than one CDCs for training the model.

In the blockchain, a pseudo random number generator is employed to generate the necessary score values for the game.
The initial seed is generated randomly by the proposed model.
A pseudo-random number is rolled 9 times and on each roll, one player displays the number, which is
broadcasted to all players in the blockchain network.
